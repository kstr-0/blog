## Getting Started (Again)
Ok, admittedly, this is now my 3rd attempt at making a blog. This time I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), which is like Hugo or Jekyll. I previously used Hugo behind the scenes of my last blog but decided to make the switch to Zola owing to it's improved execution speed as well as its template language. Zola uses [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/), which is a rust-based template engine inspired by Jinja2 and Django templates.

Given that, as a Python developer, I was already familiar with Django templates, Zola seemed like a nice choice. The theme you're looking at I made from scratch using TailwindCSS; this was my first time using the Tailwind CSS framework, and I'm quite impressed with the results. I originally learned it for use in my work so that I'm not limited to using Boostrap for every future website I design, but I think I may continue to use it for future personal projects. Hugo served me well, and given it's the most popular SSG online, it has a much larger community, so I'd still potentially recommend it over Zola if you were bilingual, as I believe it has better language support, but my initial impressions of Zola are good!
