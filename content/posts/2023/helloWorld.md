Hey! 
This is the my first blog post written in markdown on my very minimal static site generated by Hugo framework!

The blog has been built and deployed through Github Actions! The way it works is I have a Github repository containing the website generated by Hugo, and when I decide I'm going write a post, I can clone the repository, make a new markdown file in the posts directory and do a git push, where the changes will be picked up by Github Actions. The little magic elves inside the Github datacentres set up an ephermeral Linux enviroment that will clone my repository, generate the static website and then deploy it to my webserver. The SSH key and other sensitive data is stored in the enviroments secrets so I don't have to worry about having to copy them between the different machines I own.

Personally, I'm not sure if this is particularly the best method of managing a static website, however it is convenient and at the very least I can put "CI/CD" on the CV!
